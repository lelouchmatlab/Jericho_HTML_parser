Ada Lovelace is credited with writing the first algorithm intended for processing on a computer. Major achievements[edit] The German military used the Enigma machine (shown here) during World War II for communication they thought to be secret. The large-scale decryption of Enigma traffic at Bletchley Park was an important factor that contributed to Allied victory in WWII.[19] The start of the "digital revolution", which includes the current Information Age and the Internet.[20] A formal definition of computation and computability, and proof that there are computationally unsolvable and intractable problems.[21] The concept of a programming language, a tool for the precise expression of methodological information at various levels of abstraction.[22] In cryptography, breaking the Enigma code was an important factor contributing to the Allied victory in World War II.[19] Scientific computing enabled practical evaluation of processes and situations of great complexity, as well as experimentation entirely by software. It also enabled advanced study of the mind, and mapping of the human genome became possible with the Human Genome Project.[20] Distributed computing projects such as Folding@home explore protein folding. Algorithmic trading has increased the efficiency and liquidity of financial markets by using artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other statistical and numerical techniques on a large scale.[23] High frequency algorithmic trading can also exacerbate volatility.[24] Computer graphics and computer-generated imagery have become ubiquitous in modern entertainment, particularly in television, cinema, advertising, animation and video games. Even films that feature no explicit CGI are usually "filmed" now on digital cameras, or edited or postprocessed using a digital video editor.[citation needed] Simulation of various processes, including computational fluid dynamics, physical, electrical, and electronic systems and circuits, as well as societies and social situations (notably war games) along with their habitats, among many others. Modern computers enable optimization of such designs as complete aircraft. Notable in electrical and electronic circuit design are SPICE, as well as software for physical realization of new (or modified) designs. The latter includes essential design software for integrated circuits.[citation needed] Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly important as it gets more efficient and complex. There are many applications of the AI, some of which can be seen at home, such as robotic vacuum cleaners. It is also present in video games and on the modern battlefield in drones, anti-missile systems, and squad support robots.

See also: digital physics Alan Turing's insight: There are only 5 actions that a computer has to perform in order to do "anything" Every algorithm can be expressed in a language for a computer consisting of only 5 basic instructions: * move left one location * move right one location * read symbol at current location * print 0 at current location * print 1 at current location See also: Turing machine Böhm and Jacopini's insight: There are only 3 ways of combining these actions (into more complex ones) that are needed in order for a computer to do "anything" Only 3 rules are needed to combine any set of basic instructions into more complex ones: sequence: first do this; then do that selection : IF such-&-such is the case, THEN do this ELSE do that repetition: WHILE such & such is the case DO this See also: Elementary function arithmetic § Friedman's grand conjecture Academia[edit] Conferences[edit] Further information: List of computer science conferences Journals[edit] Further information: Category:Computer science journals Education[edit] See also[edit] Main article: Outline of computer science Computer science portal Academic genealogy of computer scientists Informatics (academic field) List of academic computer science departments List of computer science conferences List of computer scientists List of publications in computer science List of pioneers in computer science List of software engineering topics List of unsolved problems in computer science Women in computing Notes[edit] ^ See the entry "Computer science" on Wikiquote for the history of this quotation.

"[...] this set is the most unique and possibly the most useful to the [theoretical computer science] community, in support both of teaching and research [...]. The books can be used by anyone wanting simply to gain an understanding of one of these areas, or by someone desiring to be in research in a topic, or by instructors wishing to find timely information on a subject they are teaching outside their major areas of expertise."

"Since 1976, this has been the definitive reference work on computer, computing, and computer science. [...] Alphabetically arranged and classified into broad subject areas, the entries cover hardware, computer systems, information and data, software, the mathematics of computing, theory of computation, methodologies, applications, and computing milieu. The editors have done a commendable job of blending historical perspective and practical reference information.
